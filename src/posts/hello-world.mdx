## How it all started

I am a bachelors degree holder in Information Technology major in Network Adminstration. Upon graduation I worked in different industries until I was hired by a Japanese Automotive Software Company. I worked there for 3 years as Software Engineer focusing in on Unit Testing and Development of Engine softwares in Embedded-C Language. It was a fullfiling job however, it cannot pay the needs of the family.

To help my non-business oriented family, in the year 2017 I decided to put up a business and teach my family the system to successfully operate it.

Come 2022, I established 3 businesses for the family and is now ready to take my own path. I took trainings in web development with ![ZeroToMastery](/static/ZeroToMastery.jpeg) and Amazon Seller Vistual Assistant with ![ASVA Logo](/static/ASVA-Masterclass-Logo-01.png) to acquire competitive skillset needed for me to start anew.

## The first iteration

I finished learning React before I started to make my own portfolio website. I had several versions of my portfolio but none satisfied my liking it was all basic with a little bit of automation.

To challenge myself, I ventured into editing opensource templates with incorporated technologies foreign to me. Indeed the best way to learn is to apply it. This template is made with Next.js, Three.js and deployed on AWS which are new to me but I somehow was able to navigate.

I have now a portfolio website to my liking. I hope you like it too.
